Hi there :wave: My name is Andr√© Albuquerque and I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Remote](https://remote.com).

I live in Lisbon, Portugal üáµüáπ, with my wife and two (soon-to-be three) kids.

I like to tinker with mechanical keyboards ‚å®Ô∏è, dabble with embedded programming and generative art :art:.

To keep my head sane, I regularly practice some kind of physical activity :running:: I run, swim, play basketball, do yoga, lift weights or do calisthenics (a normal week will include three of these).
