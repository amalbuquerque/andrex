Hi there :wave: My name is Andr√© Albuquerque and I'm an Engineering Tech Lead at [Remote](https://remote.com).

I live in Lisbon, Portugal üáµüáπ, with my wife and three kids.

I like to tinker with mechanical keyboards ‚å®Ô∏è, dabble with embedded programming, home automation and generative art :art:.

In 2018 I wrote the [Mastering Elixir](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-elixir/9781788472678) and in 2020 I was a speaker at ElixirConf EU talking about using Elixir and Nerves to build a keyboard firmware from scratch. You can check it [here](/static/main/20201007_elixir_plus_nerves_plus_keys.pdf).

To keep my head sane, I regularly practice some kind of physical activity :running:: I run, swim, play basketball, do yoga, lift weights or do calisthenics. Recently I've been practicing [obstacle course racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstacle_course_racing) on a weekly basis.
